# Grade Dashbord

This project was created for my final highschool essay (PWS). It's a dashboard where teachers can import exam results by uploading an excel sheet. The server will parse the excel sheet and store all questions every student got wrong and right. Students can log into a website to see which type of questions they perform well at and which type of questions they perform less well at in a nicely presented graph, allowing for more insight into what students should practice with. Students can log into the website using their school account using Google OAuth2
